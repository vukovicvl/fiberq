FiberQ Roadmap Update — v1.1 & v1.2 (and what’s coming in v1.3+)

I’m sharing the official roadmap for FiberQ v1.1 and v1.2 — focused on making fiber network design in QGIS faster, cleaner, and more scalable.

- FiberQ v1.1 — Core Platform + UX Upgrade
This release is all about structure, speed, and daily workflow improvements:

1. Refactor: split main_plugin.py into smaller, maintainable modules

2. Codebase cleanup: translate comments/classes/methods from Serbian → English

3. Attach devices to any element (splitters, routers, etc.)

4. One main “Elements” layer + sublayers (ODF, TB, OTB, JC, etc.) + catalog

5. FTTH cable auto-offsets (consistent spacing for multiple cables on the same route)

6. Quick / Floating Toolbar for faster placement of key tools & elements

7. Layer priority / ordering: keep projects readable by auto-sorting layers like:

Poles/Manholes → Elements → Routes → Cables → Pipes → Slacks → Objects → Areas

- FiberQ v1.2 — Network Logic + Fiber Visibility
Next version will focus on “what’s inside the cables” and how fibers connect end-to-end:

1. Fiber Splicing Manager

1. Optical Fiber Diagram / Schematic generator & viewer (for connected fiber paths)

- v1.3+ (Later)
There are more ideas on the table (e.g., building mode / riser workflows, deeper validation, etc.), but they’ll be considered after v1.1 and v1.2 are delivered.

FiberQ is open-source and community-driven — feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
